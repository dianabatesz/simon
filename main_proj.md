# Major Project

## Within the past 3 weeks, we have learned A TON of stuff.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS
	* Basic programming logic
	* Arrays
	* Loops
	* Conditionals
	* Object Orientated Programming
	* DOM
- jQuery
- GitHub/Git
- Command Line Interface

Now, it's time to put all of this stuff together.

## Let's build something that's relevant to you - your own personal website.

Something like this might be extremely useful for you, either now or down the road.  Imagine showing educators that you've created your own legitimate website at your age... something like this could really make a difference.  The education you've received is incredibly unique - let's use it.

### User Flow

Think about how you'd want someone to view your site.  You can use jQuery's fadeIn() or fadeOut(), do things on button click to manipulate the HTML, or have click events, etc etc...  

Make this something you'd be proud of/something you could update as you go through more things in life. 

### Week 4's Plan

The plan for this week is for y'all to create something phenomenal.  I'll obviously be here to help.

I'll teach some supplemental lessons throughout the week.  Some CSS stuff, some JS stuff.  But, I'm not going to teach you guys any major new things.  You are young and talented... there's no need to learn back end servers at your age.  If you want to pursue development as a career, learn whatever is new at the time.  The thing about tech is that it's always changing!

Thanks for being amazing students.  It's been real.  :)
